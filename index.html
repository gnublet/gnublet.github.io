                 <h3>My first online webpage</h1>
<p>Hello! Welcome to my first blog! Here I'll try to post daily thoughts on what I've learned on my path to become a data scientist, software engineer, or developer. I was recommended to do this at the fullstack meetup in LA, which is awesome! My learning rate has exponentially increased by learning to code with others! To get started, I've made my first online webpage using <a href = "https://pages.github.com/">github</a>! I got a working toolbar (but there's little functionality right now). I also learned how to push changes using git! But now it's is 3:45am for me so I should probably sleep.</p>


                    <h2 id="day1-sec">Day 1</h2>
                        <h3>My First Map</h3>
<p>Wow, Leaflet and Mapbox unlock new possibilities. I came across Leaflet by doing pair programming at Fullstack LA. Here are some of my favorite views around: the Getty Center (especially right after a storm) and the Santa Monica Pier. Try clicking my markers or the circle! I'll wait. Clicking anywhere else brings up a popup telling you the latitude and longitude. What's your latitude and longitude? Later, I'd like to dive deeper into GeoJSON and Mapbox.<br>

I'm starting to notice that things stay interesting when I don't stick too closely to tutorials and start exploring and tinkering with code. It get's a more personal feel, which also makes it unforgettable. My writing also could use some work :) I'm thinking about making a map based game with interaction between players. Not sure what though since from my understanding, this site is static: no SQL support for now (but it's free) .</p>

                    <h2>Day 2</h2>
                        <h3>Making this look pretty with CSS</h3>
                        <p>The <a href="index2.html">previous site</a>
 was probably the ugliest page posted on the internet. It didn't make too much use of CSS, only HTML and some javascript. By using CSS, we can get something that isn't too bad. The nice thing about web design is that there's lots of free stuff out there. I tweaked a free template that fit my preferences: I wanted an interface that was all in 1 page so you don't need to click around if you don't want to. In the future, I will look at how to load pages incrementally instead of all at once, to make the page run faster. For the technical aspects of software engineering, I'm learning about trees, starting with binary trees. These are useful in binary search trees (BST) to support quick searching, inserting, and deleting, Huffman coding for data compression, and binary search partitioning (used in video games by recursively dividing your image space). </p>

                    <h2>Day 3</h2>
                        <h3>Python Day</h3>
                        <p> I spent most of the day driving. That's the cost of living in LA. Anyways, I went to a Python Meetup in Little Tokyo where I met some people and talked about python stuff: Tensorflow, scapy, scikit-learn, jupyter notebook, and all that jazz. Lots of people are interested in data science and that seems to be the leading motivation to learn python.
                        I explored some functionality that I didn't know existed. I played around with the dir() function which, along with help() allows quick python learning. I also noticed that in python 3, to define a class, you don't need to have object in parenthesis and can just write<br><br>
                        <strong>class nameOfClass:</strong>
                        <br><br>
                        rather than<br><br>
                        <strong>class nameOfClass(object):</strong><br><br>
                        But on examining this further, parenthesis is how python uses inheritance, and ommitting them is not recommended. For instance, 
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>class Stack(object):</strong><br><br>
                        inherits nothing, while<br><br>
                        <strong>class Stack(list):</strong><br><br>
                        inherits all the methods of list. Using dir(), we see that this new Stack() class has append(), insert(), pop(), sort(), etc.<br><br>
                        I also learned more about generators, which, instead of returning a value, can generate entire sequences using 'yield'. This is useful when you know you'll be working with a huge result set and don't need most of the results. 
  </p>

                    <h2>Day 4</h2>
                    <h3>A relaxing python day</h3>
                    <p>
                    Since it's Saturday, I'm taking it easy and not pushing myself to code too much. It's always good to take a break once in a while. On weekends, I'll just talk about general things. That said, I briefly learned about python coroutines (functions which allow sequences of inputs through (yield)), although I don't understand their applications yet. I also continued an application for a paid data science grad school opportunity funded by Red Bull. They have this very in depth test at wingfinder.com that is sort of a combination of an IQ and an EQ test. For people who have done some psychology, it uses concepts from the WAIS test, Myers Briggs test, and decision time (it takes longer to make a hard decision than an easier one) to predict if you're intro/extroverted. Here are my shortened <a href="talent-passport.pdf">results</a> which I'm happy with. The actual results are more in depth, but that's for me :).</p>

                    <h2>Day 5</h2>
                    <h3>Useful Python tools</h3>
                    <p>
                    Today I learned how to use 2 very useful tools: scrapy and sqlite. Scrapy is a web crawling framework where I followed a tutorial on collecting data from a quotes website and outputing a JSON file containing the quotes and authors. I will later attempt to extract news locations, summaries, and try to map the locations onto a map. This will make us more geographically aware and could be useful tool for news reporters. I learned to use Sqlite since I wanted to find a way to use SQL for storing data without the huge overhead of the other traditional methods. For example, a couple of weeks ago, I played around with XAMPP which is a cross platform Apache distribution containing everything you'd need for a web server, but there's a lot to know: PHP, MariaDB, etc. Since I just wanted to practice my database querying abilities, this was a little too much. For the next few days, I'll try to go deeper into Scrapy and saving to different formats (like csv). I put the files in my <a href="https://github.com/gnublet/py_explorations"l> py_explorations</a> folder on github.</p>

                    <h2>Day 6</h2>
                    <h3>Diving deeper into Tensorflow</h3>
                    <p>
                    I haven't posted in about a week since I needed to prepare for some tutoring materials which I do on the side to make a living. I've started 2 courses: a Stanford course on Algorithms on Coursera and an Udacity course on using tensorflow for machine learning. This will ensure that I make at least some steady progress over time. I'm currently working on classification of the noMNIST dataset which is slightly more complicated than the MNIST dataset, where the objective is to get the computer to classify messy handwritten digits. The drawbacks of tensorflow is that it takes extremely long to run, so in the future, I will reduce the dataset sizes. I also played around with the mido library, but it's still pretty complicated to me. I would like to be able to play computer generated music in the future. I also fixed my first ruby class which became my first pull request during the Fullstack Meetup. Even though it was a 1 symbol fix, I'm still happy I noticed it without knowing ruby. I'm continuing the spider crawling script, and am planning to use it on a random wikipedia page. I learned that there is ettiquete that people need to follow when crawling sites (I need to make it seem human by putting delays between crawled pages). I also need to get better at organizing future projects since I'm getting side tracked a lot now. So what I'll do is rank my tasks by priority and split them up into smaller managable problems that can be tackled in a day or so. So tomorrow should be a web crawler day! Hopefully I can do it!</p>

                    <h2>Day 7</h2>
                    <h3>Bay Area Deep Learning School 2016</h3>
                    <p>
                    Today I watched a stream of the Bay Area Deep Learning School at Stanford where a bunch of top big data people including Andrew Ng (who is the one who first introduced me to machine learning) are giving talks. He talked about modernizing the bias variance tradeoff concept. Instead of traditionally splitting your data into training, development (validation), and test sets, we should split our data into training, training-development, development, and test sets. The principle is that the underlying distributions of the test and development sets should be the same, when in reality they often aren't. Andrew Ng shares with us his wisdom in starting a career: read papers, replicate results, and don't stall to avoid dirty work (data cleaning, installing stuff, etc.) in parallel.

                    I'm also still trying to run the web crawler (I chose reuters instead), but am in the process of debugging an error.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Day 8</h2>
                    <h3>Learning React</h3>
                    <p>
                    I know I said I would try to stay focused, but it was the weekend, and spent the day celebrating my sister's birthday. After coming back home, I somehow got side tracked into learning React (I don't even remember how). I found myself on Codeacademy (which is very noob friendly) and learned an interesting thing called Virtual DOMs. A Document Object Model (DOM) defines the logical structure of documents (like in an HTML file). We can visualize this structure like a tree of objects.<br> 
                    <img src="htmltree.gif" alt="htmltree" style="width:400px;height:300px;"><br>


                    However, rebuilding the entire DOM is inefficient. Instead, it's better to keep changes in a Virtual DOM (a temporary DOM), and then use React to figure out which Virtual DOM objects changed. This is very similar to the diff concept in github, which is way more efficient. I find this kind of thing really interesting since it's sort of like choosing the most efficient algorithm for your problem. Sure, it takes a little (memory?) space, but significantly reduces runtime which is a great tradeoff for most websites. I think I should eventually implement this concept to reduce the load time of this website by loading the page in chunks. Also please let me know if I'm ever completely off about anything! I'd love to be wrong if I can learn something from it.

                  <h1 class="g-pad-bottom">  <i class="fa fa-crosshairs"></i>About Me </h1>
                    <p>In high school, I didn't really have plans for my future, and wasn't even sure about going to college. I ended up getting accepted to UC Riverside, even though I didn't apply there. During the summer in between high school and college, I worked my first full time, 9-5 job selling drugs. <br><br>

At a pharmacy. <br><br>

This was my first time I was sort of independent, so I wanted to see what I was capable of. Every morning I arrived at the pharmacy about 45 minutes early and read pages from 2 books: Calculus of a Single Variable by J. W. Kitchen and Chemistry by Oxtoby and Gillis. Maybe it was the quiet atmosphere I had in the front of my car, but I have never felt so focused. As I read the first chapter out of Kitchen's dusty book, I felt as if I was learning magic or something. Powerful, general truths were revealed in the cleanest arguments I've seen. Oxtoby simulaneously showed how the universe was connected at all levels. This was the first time I saw a hint of emergent phenomenon: how important structures like atoms, cells, organs, life, or planets, emerge from smaller scales. Many people attribute this to a god, but to me, it was something more.<br><br>

I then decided to major in physics. I was a little late since I wasn't taking any real physics classes my first semester, only an ungraded seminar. However all the physics classes depended on finishing the lower division series. Since I didn't meet the prereqs, I decided to take a bunch of math classes for fun. I was reminded of math's general truth revealing properties. So I decided to take a second major in pure math. I then happened to come across an email about the Putnam math competition, an annual undergraduate math competition in the US and Canada. The average score each year tends to be around 1/120 and each problem is worth 10 points...Yeah, it's that hard. But what the heck, what's there to lose? We would have unofficial weekly club meetings to talk about relatively low level problems. Simply following the ideas of my friends taught me a lot about other ways of thinking. Small communities like this made my time at UC Riverside very well spent.<br><br>

Before graduating, I faced a familiar problem of not knowing what to do with my life, so I just went with the natural choice by attending the physics PhD program at Ohio State. I honestly chose the school based on their building and how much more money they offered compared to California. This was a period where I started to stagnate. I was learning almost nothing in terms of science since I've already learned the topics as a junior in college, even using the exact same books. However, I did gain self-confidence by teaching classes. In the past, I've always feared publc speaking. I felt nervous at first, but over time, I learned to turn the nerves into excitement which fueled my teaching. Teaching actually became fun! So, by the time I left, I felt it was time well spent.<br><br>

I later transfered to the cognitive psychology department since I found a new interesting question: how does consciousness emerge from neurons and glia. I started pondering this after doing a computer letter recognition project in one of my computational physics classes. However, it was in this new psychology program where I realized that confidence was domain specific. Even though I was comfortable with my math and physics, I had absolutely no knowledge of psychology or statistics. I could pick the pieces up, but there where more pieces than I could count. I still maintained a high GPA, but there's a huge difference between doing well and feeling confident. I also realized that in the long run, a cognitive psychology PhD leads nowhere except academia much like the type of physics I was doing a year earlier. So I left.<br><br>




 Up until recently, my life goal was just to learn as much as I could. Now, my perspective is starting to change. Knowing things doesn't really change anything, it's what you do and how you do it. Life is too precious to spend it all on one small detail. With data science, statistics, and computer science, you have the tools to explore anything of interest, deeply and efficiently, while bettering the world and connecting with people.

Here's something I've been thinking about. Instead of making decisions based on outcomes, I should try weighting outcomes together with the quality of the journey<sup>1</sup>. If you had to choose between winning a Nobel prize and being stressed for 40 years, or having accomplished little, but were happy the entire time, which would you choose?<br><br>

Computer science gives you the power and courage to choose your own path. If jobs aren't available, make them! This is one of my reasons for showing my journey and hopefully I can express how high the sky really is.<br><br>

Thanks!<br><br>
