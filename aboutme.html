<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>In high school, I didn't really have plans for my future, and wasn't even sure about going to college. I ended up getting accepted to UC Riverside, even though I didn't apply there. During the summer in between high school and college, I worked my first full time, 9-5 job selling drugs. <br><br>

At a pharmacy. <br><br>

This was my first time I was sort of independent, so I wanted to see what I was capable of. Every morning I arrived at the pharmacy about 45 minutes early and read pages from 2 books: Calculus of a Single Variable by J. W. Kitchen and Chemistry by Oxtoby and Gillis. Maybe it was the quiet atmosphere I had in the front of my car, but I never felt so focused. As I read the first chapter out of Kitchen's dusty book, I felt as if I was learning magic or something. Powerful, general truths were revealed in the cleanest arguments I've seen. Oxtoby simulaneously showed how the universe was connected at all levels. This was the first time I saw a hint of emergent phenomenon: how important structures like atoms, cells, organs, life, or planets, emerge from smaller scales. Many people attribute this to a god, but to me, it was something more.<br><br>

I then decided to major in physics. I was a little late since I wasn't taking any real physics classes my first semester, only an ungraded seminar. However all the physics classes depended on finishing the lower division series. Since I didn't meet the prereqs, I decided to take a bunch of math classes for fun. These classes further reminded me of how math reveals so many general truths in such a beautiful way. So I decided to take a second major in pure math. I happened to come across an email about the Putnam math competition, an annual undergraduate math competition in the US and Canada. The average score each year tends to be around 1/120 and each problem is worth 10 points...Yeah, it's that hard. Well, what's there to lose? We would have unofficial weekly club meetings to talk about relatively low level problems. Simply following the ideas of my friends taught me a lot about other ways of thinking. Small communities like this made my time at UC Riverside very well spent.<br><br>

Before graduating, I faced a similar problem of not knowing what I wanted to do with my life, so I just went with the natural choice by attending the physics PhD program at Ohio State. I honestly chose the school based on their building and how much more money they offered compared to California. This was a period where I started to stagnate. I was learning almost nothing in terms of science since I've already learned the topics as a junior in college, even using the exact same books. However, I did gain self-confidence by teaching classes. In the past, I've always feared publc speaking. I felt nervous at first, but over time, I learned to turn the nerves into excitement which fueled my teaching. Teaching actually became fun! So, by the time I left, I felt it was time well spent.<br><br>

I later transfered to the cognitive psychology department since I found a new interesting question: how does consciousness emerge from neurons and glia. I started pondering this after doing a computer letter recognition project in one of my computational physics classes. However, it was in this new psychology program where I realized that confidence was domain specific. Even though I was comfortable with my math and physics, I had absolutely no knowledge of psychology or statistics. I could pick the pieces up, but there where more pieces than I could count. I still maintained a high GPA, but there's a huge difference between doing well and feeling confident. I also realized that in the long run, a cognitive psychology PhD leads nowhere except academia much like the type of physics I was doing a year earlier. So I left.<br><br>




 Up until recently, my life goal was just to learn as much as I could. Now, my perspective is starting to change. Knowing things doesn't really change anything, it's what you do and how you do it. Life is too precious to spend it all on one small detail. With data science, statistics, and computer science, you have the tools to explore anything of interest, deeply and efficiently, while bettering the world and connecting with people.<br><br>

I've been naive. Instead of making decisions based on final outcomes, try weighting outcomes together with the quality of the journey<sup>1</sup>. If you had to choose between winning a Nobel prize and being stressed for 40 years, or having accomplished little, but were happy the entire time, which would you choose?<br><br>

Computer science gives you the power to choose your own path, if jobs aren't available (at least in theory). This is partly my reason of showing you my journey and hopefully I can express how high the sky really is.<br><br>

Thanks!<br><br>
