<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>In high school, I didn't really have plans for my future, but ended up at UC Riverside, even though I didn't apply. During the summer in between high school and college, I worked my first full time, 9-5 job selling drugs. <br><br>

At a pharmacy. <br><br>

This was my first time I on my own, so I wanted to see what I was capable of. Every morning I arrived at the pharmacy about 45 minutes early and read pages from 2 books: Calculus of a Single Variable by J. W. Kitchen and Chemistry by Oxtoby and Gillis. As I read Kitchen's book, I felt as if I was learning secrets to the universe. Oxtoby me about emergent phenomenon: how structures have similarities at different length and time scales.<br><br>

This led me to decide on a major in physics and while I was taking the basic sequence, I decided to take a bunch of math classes for fun. These classes reminded me of math's general power. So I decided to take a second major in pure math. I happened to come across an email about the Putnam math competition, an annual undergraduate math competition in the US and Canada. The average score each year tends to be around 1/120 and each problem is worth 10 points. We would have unofficial weekly club meetings to talk about relatively low level problems. Simply discussing math problems with my friends taught me a lot about other ways of thinking. Small communities like this made my time at UC Riverside very well spent.<br><br>

Before graduating, I faced a similar problem of not knowing what I wanted to do with my life, so I just went with the natural choice by attending the physics PhD program at Ohio State. This was a period where I started to stagnate as I had already learned the topics as a junior in college, using the exact same texts. However, I did gain self-confidence by teaching classes. In the past, my greatest fear was public speaking. Over time, I learned to convert my rapidly beating heart to energize my teaching. Teaching actually became fun! So, by the time I left, I've grown more than I could imagine.<br><br>

I later transfered to the cognitive psychology department since I found a new interesting question: how does consciousness emerge from neurons and glia. I started pondering this after doing a computer letter recognition project in one of my computational physics classes. However, it was in this new psychology program where I realized that confidence was domain specific. Even though I was comfortable with my math and physics, I had absolutely no knowledge of psychology or statistics. I still maintained a high GPA, but there's a huge difference between doing well and feeling confident. I also realized that in the long run, a cognitive psychology PhD leads nowhere except academia much like the type of physics I was doing a year earlier. So I left to gain real world experience.<br><br>


Up until recently, my life goal was to learn as much as I could. Now, my perspective is starting to change. Knowing things doesn't really change anything, it's what you can do with that knowledge and skill. With machine learning, we now have the tools to explore anything of interest while having the potential to drastically change the world! This is one of many reasons why I want to enter the field of machine learning.<br><br>


Thanks!<br><br>
